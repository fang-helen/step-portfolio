# Google Student Training in Engineering Program

This repo contains Helen  Fang's portfolio and STEP starter projects.  
<br />
The [portfolio/](https://github.com/fang-helen/step-portfolio/tree/master/portfolio) directory contains an interactive portfolio page where visitors can add comments and translate content.
<br />
<br />
The [walkthroughs/week-5-tdd/project/](https://github.com/fang-helen/step-portfolio/tree/master/walkthroughs/week-5-tdd/project) directory contains a meeting scheduling application that searches for available time slots for meetings that do not conflict with any of the mandatory attendees' schedules. When optional attendees are involved, my solution searches for the time slot(s) where the greatest number of optional attendees would be able to attend using a recursive depth-first search algorithm.
