            <p>I will be a sophomore at UT Austin this fall. I like to think that I have 
                a reputation of being a reliable, efficient worker and having an 
                easygoing personality. I’m interested in computer science because I like 
                math and logic, and found programming to be really fun after I first 
                learned Java in high school.</p>
            <p>I have four years of coding experience, and this is my first technical 
                internship. Before this, I’ve dabbled in a variety of miscellaneous 
                activities -- last year, I held an internship with the media department 
                in the Travis County Tax Office, where I translated several PSAs relating 
                to vehicle titling, voter registration, and more into Mandarin. I taught  
                SAT on the weekends in high school, and currently work as a tutor for math 
                and computer science at UT’s Sanger Langer Center. I’ve also been playing 
                piano since I was 5, and have organized my own jewelry-making classes.</p>
