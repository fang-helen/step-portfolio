        <p>Hello! My name is Helen. I am a computer science student at 
            the University of Texas at Austin and aspiring software engineer.</p>
        <p>I will be a sophomore at UT Austin this fall. I like to think that I have 
            a reputation of being a reliable, efficient worker and having an 
            easygoing personality. I’m interested in computer science because I like 
            math and logic, and found programming to be really fun after I first 
            learned Java in high school.</p>
        <p>I have four years of coding experience, and this is my first technical 
            internship. Before this, I’ve dabbled in a variety of miscellaneous 
            activities -- last year, I held an internship with the media department 
            in the Travis County Tax Office, where I translated several PSAs relating 
            to vehicle titling, voter registration, and more into Mandarin. I currently 
            work as a tutor for math and computer science at UT’s Sanger Langer Center, 
            and taught SAT on the weekends in high school. I’ve also been playing piano 
            since I was 5, and have organized my own jewelry-making classes.</p>
